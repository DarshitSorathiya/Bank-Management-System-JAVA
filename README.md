## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or higher installed.
- **JDBC Driver**: You will need the appropriate JDBC driver for your database. Make sure to download it and include it in your project's classpath.

3. **Add JDBC Driver**:

Download the JDBC driver for your database (e.g., MySQL Connector/J for MySQL).

Place the JDBC driver JAR file in the lib directory of the project or add it to your IDE's build path.

4. **Configure Database Connection**:

Edit the database.properties file (or equivalent configuration file) to include your database URL, username, and password.

```Example:
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
db.username=your_username
db.password=your_password
```

5. **Build and Run the Application**:

Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).
Build the project using your IDE's build tools.

Run the BankManagementSystem class to start the application.
